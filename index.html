        <h2>ADVICE TO RECIPE</h2>
        <p>The cream recipe (I want to warn you that it turns out to be fat enough). Ingredients: 150 g of sugar; 6 tablespoons
          of water; 1 packet of vanilla extract; 3 yolks; 220 g of butter (soften to room temperature). Cooking method. In
          a small saucepan, mix the sugar with water, put on fire and cook for a few minutes to make a syrup. Check the syrup
          for readiness: the syrup should be stretched with a thin thread. Beat the yolks in a lush, light mass, gradually
          add the syrup, whisk until the mass becomes lush. Beat the mixer with oil in a lush mass, add yolk mass, beat well.
          It turns out a gentle cream cream.</p>
